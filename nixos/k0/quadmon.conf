    # Set up monitor poweroff settings. For our monitors, the option below is
    # the same as `xset dpms force off' after 60 minutes of inactivity, which
    # makes the screens display nothing but a black image, but does not
    # actually turn the monitors off.
    #
    # Also, suspending seems to do the same thing as stand by, so we disable it.
    # We also disable OffTime because it does not work properly on our hardware
    # (screen turns off only momentarily before coming back on). We need to set
    # these unused values to 0, because otherwise they are set to "10" (minutes)
    # by default. See `xset q' under the DPMS section for details.
