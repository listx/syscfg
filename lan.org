* Current setup
- The 3801HGV residental gateway (RG) has an IP address of 192.168.1.1.
- The rosewill router is acting in AP Router Mode, and has an ethernet connection through its INTERNET port to the RG.
- The k0 desktop's ethernet is connected into the LAN port of the rosewill, and has DHCP enabled.
- The rosewill's IP address is 192.168.0.1, and it has DMZ enabled on this IP address also.
- The rosewill has DHCP server enabled, so all devices connecting to it is assigned an IP address of 192.168.0.X.
- The rosewill has its own ESSID WLAN being broadcast, which is DIFFERENT than the one in RG.
