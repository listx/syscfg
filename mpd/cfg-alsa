# See the mpd.conf man page for a more detailed description of each parameter.

# Required files and directories ##############################################
#
# This setting controls the top directory which MPD will search to discover the
# available audio files and add them to the daemon's online database.
#
music_directory "/home/listdata/.mpd-untracked/music"
#
# This setting sets the MPD internal playlist directory. The purpose of this
# directory is storage for playlists created by MPD. The server will use 
# playlist files not created by the server but only if they are in the MPD
# format.
#
playlist_directory "/home/listdata/.mpd-untracked/playlist"
#
# This setting sets the location of the MPD database. This file is used to
# load the database at server start up and store the database while the 
# server is not up.
#
db_file "/home/listdata/.mpd-untracked/mpd.db"
# 
# These settings are the locations for the daemon log files for the daemon.
# These logs are great for troubleshooting, depending on your log_level
# settings.

###############################################################################


# Optional files ##############################################################
#
# This setting sets the location of the file which stores the process ID
# for use of mpd --kill and some init scripts. This setting is disabled by
# default.
#
pid_file "/home/listdata/.mpd-untracked/mpd.pid"
#
# This setting sets the location of the file which contains information about
# most variables to get MPD back into the same general shape it was in before

#
###############################################################################


# General music daemon options ################################################
#
# This setting specifies the user that MPD will run as, if set. MPD should
# never run as root and you may use this setting to make MPD change its user 
# id after initialization. Do not use this setting if you start MPD as an
# unprivileged user. This setting is disabled by default, and the server will
# run as root.
#
user "listdata"
#
# This setting sets the address for the daemon to listen on. Careful attention
# should be paid if this is assigned to anything other then the default, any.
# This setting can deny access to control of the daemon.
#
# For network
bind_to_address		"localhost" # if no one else on the LAN wants to use this mpd
#bind_to_address		"192.168.0.110" # bind it to this computer's IP address if someone on the LAN wants to use this mpd
#
# And for Unix Socket
#bind_to_address		"/home/listdata/.mpd/socket"
#
# This setting is the port that is desired for the daemon to get assigned to.
#
port				"6600"
#
# This setting controls the type of information which is logged. Available 
# setting arguments are "default", "secure" or "verbose". The "verbose" setting
# argument is recommended for troubleshooting, though can quickly stretch
# available resources on limited hardware storage.
#
#log_level			"verbose"
#
# If you have a problem with your MP3s ending abruptly it is recommended that 
# you set this argument to "no" to attempt to fix the problem. If this solves
# the problem, it is highly recommended to fix the MP3 files with vbrfix
# (available from <http://www.willwap.co.uk/Programs/vbrfix.php>), at which
# point gapless MP3 playback can be enabled.
#
#gapless_mp3_playback			"yes"
#
# This setting enables MPD to create playlists in a format usable by other
# music players.
#
#save_absolute_paths_in_playlists	"no"

# symbolic links outside of the configured #music_directory "path_to_your_music_collection"
#
#follow_outside_symlinks	"yes"
#
# If this setting is set to "yes, MPD will discover audio files by following
# symbolic links inside of the configured #music_directory "path_to_your_music_collection"
#
#follow_inside_symlinks		"yes"
#
###############################################################################

# Zeroconf / Avahi Service Discovery ##########################################

# Audio Output ################################################################
#
# MPD supports various audio output types, as well as playing through multiple 
# audio outputs at the same time, through multiple audio_output settings 
# blocks. Setting this block is optional, though the server will only attempt
# autodetection for one sound card.
#
# See <http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Configuration#Audio_Outputs> for examples of 
# other audio outputs.
#
# An example of an ALSA output:
#
audio_output {
    type			"alsa"
    name			"Exelion ALSA output"
#   device			"hw:0,0"	# optional
    format			"44100:16:2"	# optional
}
#
# An example of an OSS output:
#
#audio_output {
#	type			"oss"
#	name			"My OSS Device"
#	device			"/dev/dsp"	# optional
#	format			"44100:16:2"	# optional
#}

#
# An example of a pulseaudio output (streaming to a remote pulseaudio server)
#
#audio_output {
#	type			"pulse"
#	name			"My Pulse Output"
#	server			"remote_server"
#	sink			"remote_server_sink"
#}
#
## An example of a null output (for no audio output):
#
#audio_output {
#	type			"null"
#	name			"My Null Output"
#}
#
# This setting will change all decoded audio to be converted to the specified
# format before being passed to the audio outputs. By default, this setting is
# disabled.
#
#audio_output_format		"44100:16:2"
#
# If MPD has been compiled with libsamplerate support, this setting specifies 
# the sample rate converter to use.  Possible values can be found in the 
# mpd.conf man page or the libsamplerate documentation. By default, this is
# setting is disabled.
#
#samplerate_converter		"Fastest Sinc Interpolator"
#
###############################################################################


# Volume control mixer ########################################################
#
# MPD has limited volume controls, to use them pick one below. If one is not
# specified it may be autodetected at startup, depending on the dependencies
# which were compiled into the server.
#
# An example for controlling an ALSA mixer:
#
mixer_type			"alsa"
mixer_device			"default"
mixer_control			"PCM"
#
# An example for controlling an OSS mixer:
#
#mixer_type			"oss"
#mixer_device			"/dev/mixer"
#mixer_control			"PCM"
#
# This example is a general volume control mixer, it is used to adjust the 
# volume of the audio sent to the audio output, and will work with all outputs.
#
#mixer_type			"software"
#
###############################################################################


# Normalization automatic volume adjustments ##################################
#

# are doing.
#
#audio_buffer_size		"2048"
#
# This setting controls the percentage of the buffer which is filled before 
# beginning to play. Increasing this reduces the chance of audio file skipping, 
# at the cost of increased time prior to audio playback.
