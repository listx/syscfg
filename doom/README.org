#+TITLE: Literate Emacs configuration
#+AUTHOR: Linus Arver
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle no :noweb no-export

* Introduction

We use DOOM emacs (insert link) as a base configuration, and further customize it here in literate form.

** About the top-level PROPERTY settings for this buffer
- These property settings take effect when the buffer is loaded. So that means if you change these settings, you have to reload the buffer for them to take effect.
- We set =:tangle no-export= by default for all source code blocks. This is because the =literate= DOOM module by default tangles all emacs-lisp source code blocks to config.el, which defeats the purpose of literate programming (where the raw order of how things are defined do **not** dictate how the end result looks like).
- We set =:noweb no-export= to enable Noweb's =<<LINK>>= syntax in all source code blocks during **tangling** (=config.el= generation) and **evaluation** (when running a code snippet from org-mode with =C-c C-c=). However when we export this org-mode file (e.g., publish it to HTML), we do **NOT** expand it because we want to reveal the underlying noweb structure to the reader. Anyway, turning on noweb for tangling and evaluating allows us to inject source code anywhere and also define them freely.

** Guiding principles

- **Modular output**: We make sure that the output file(s) that are "tangled" out of here stay nice and clean in a modular way. We do **NOT** want to have a giant 2000 line file with everything in it with no modularity, because it hurts readability for the case where we want to debug our configuration at the raw Emacs lisp level.

- **Bird's eye view**: We discuss the most important high-level topics first, and leave the finer details at the end.

* How DOOM loads configs

DOOM requires 3 configuration files in the =$DOOMDIR=:

- =init.el=: This is where DOOM "modules" are loaded; modules are just collections of Emacs packages and configurations. This file is pretty small and straightforward.
- =packages.el=: This is where additional packages are installed (or disabled if they are pulled in by DOOM).
- =config.el=: This is where all of our custom configuration goes. Note that this file can pull in other =*.el= files as well if we want to.

* $DOOMDIR/init.el

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load
;; in. Remember to run 'doom sync' after modifying it!

;; NOTE Press 'SPC h d h' (or 'C-h d h' for non-vim users) to access Doom's
;;      documentation. There you'll find a "Module Index" link where you'll find
;;      a comprehensive list of Doom's modules and what flags they support.

;; NOTE Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press 'K' (or
;;      'C-c c k' for non-vim users) to view its documentation. This works on
;;      flags as well (those symbols that start with a plus).
;;
;;      Alternatively, press 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') on a module to browse its
;;      directory (for easy access to its source code).

#+end_src

** Change DOOM's leader key from "SPC" to ","

Here's a rundown of these all-important leader keys:

- =doom-leader-key=: Global leader key for global functions that should work regardless of whatever major mode is active.
- =doom-leader-alt-key=: Same as =doom-leader-key=, but accessible from Evil's Insert and Emacs states.
- =doom-localleader-key=: Major-mode-specific leader key. Brings up lots of commands that are specific to the current major mode.
- =doom-localleader-alt-key=: Same as =doom-localleader-alt-key=, but accessible from Evil's Insert and Emacs states.

NOTE: For all of DOOM's bindings, you can just press the keys and pause, and the minibuffer will tell you what keys are available. So you can explore what options are available interactively!

In order to use =C-,= from terminal Emacs, you have to make your terminal (e.g., Alacritty) send a special sequence (such as the =CSI u= scheme) and also make Emacs understand that sequence.

;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
;;; $DOOMDIR/packages.el

;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here and run 'doom sync'
;; on the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
;; use 'M-x doom/reload'.

;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
;; `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;(package! another-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;(package! this-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here
;; with the `:disable' property:
;(package! builtin-package :disable t)

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
;; all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
;; This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
;; our package manager can't deal with; see raxod502/straight.el#279)
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))

;; Use `:pin' to specify a particular commit to install.
;(package! builtin-package :pin "1a2b3c4d5e")


;; Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
;; release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...

* $DOOMDIR/config.el

This is the final structured output of =$DOOMDIR/config.el=, which is a special file that DOOM recognizes. Because of the way it acts as the "main" configuration file, you can think of it as =init.el= in the traditional Emacs sense. DOOM has its own =init.el= but that is another matter.

Note that this file is pretty much **required** and acts as the base for all other configurations that are pulled in. And so we define it first here.

** CSI u mode support
See https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/1020/problems-with-keybindings-when-using-terminal/13957#13957 for a discussion of ~CSI u~ mode. Basically for us it allows us to use =C-S-= bindings from terminal emacs. It also allows us to specify many special keys in an unambiguous manner, so that we can, e.g., make =C-i= be recognized as =C-i= in terminal emacs (and not simply as =TAB= as is the default behavior).

For information on how xterm does it, see https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html and search for ~modifyOtherKeys~.

*** Splits (window creation)

Splitting windows happens so frequently that we put these bindings at the top level just after the leader key.

      "+" #'balance-windows
      "\\" #'enlarge-window-horizontally
      "|" #'shrink-window-horizontally)
#+end_src

**** Dead code

We used to use this to always split and rebalance. However in practice the need to rebalance does not arise that frequently because by default the initial split will be balanced.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun l/split-vertically ()
  "Split window verically."

*** Deletion

If there are multiple windows, close the current window. Otherwise close the current tab if there are mulitple tabs. Otherwise, try to exit emacs.

We take care to tread around so-called "auxiliary" buffers, which are auto-generated buffers from various emacs modes/packages.

* Org mode

By default evil-org-mode makes =M-j= move the subtree (bound to ~org-forward-element~). But instead we change things so that =M-<letter>= nondestructively navigates, and =M-S-<letter>= moves things around. This is more intuitive to me, at least.

Note that we have to use =M-J= to encode =M-S-j=. This appears to be Emacs convention.

** Notes

In insert mode, type =<s= followed by =TAB= to auto-complete a ~#+begin_src~ and ~#+end_src~ code block.

* Misc settings

** Personal information

Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email clients, file templates and snippets.
#+name: name-and-email
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Linus Arver"
      user-mail-address "linusarver@gmail.com")
#+end_src

This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to "nil", line numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to "relative".
#+name: line-numbers
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type nil)
#+end_src

** Dead code

Before we started using Doom Emacs, we used to rely heavily on kakapo-mode to always insert either a tab or space character with the =TAB= key. However nowadays most languages have automated formatters that takes the guesswork around tabs/spaces out of the way. We could still enable kakapo-mode for some of the simpler modes that do not have a formatter, but for now we don't bother.

#+name: kakapo
