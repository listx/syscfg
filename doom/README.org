#+TITLE: Literate Emacs configuration
#+AUTHOR: Linus Arver
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle no :noweb no-export

* Introduction

We use DOOM emacs (insert link) as a base configuration, and further customize it here in literate form.

** About the top-level PROPERTY settings for this buffer
- These property settings take effect when the buffer is loaded. So that means if you change these settings, you have to reload the buffer for them to take effect.
- We set =:tangle no-export= by default for all source code blocks. This is because the =literate= DOOM module by default tangles all elisp source code blocks to config.el, which defeats the purpose of literate programming (where the raw order of how things are defined do **not** dictate how the end result looks like).
- We set =:noweb no-export= to enable Noweb's =<<LINK>>= syntax in all source code blocks during **tangling** (=config.el= generation) and **evaluation** (when running a code snippet from org-mode with =C-c C-c=). However when we export this org-mode file (e.g., publish it to HTML), we do **NOT** expand it because we want to reveal the underlying noweb structure to the reader. Anyway, turning on noweb for tangling and evaluating allows us to inject source code anywhere and also define them freely.

** Guiding principles

- **Modular output**: We make sure that the output file(s) that are "tangled" out of here stay nice and clean in a modular way. We do **NOT** want to have a giant 2000 line file with everything in it with no modularity, because it hurts readability for the case where we want to debug our configuration at the raw Emacs lisp level.

- **Bird's eye view**: We discuss the most important high-level topics first, and leave the finer details at the end.

* How DOOM loads configs

DOOM requires 3 configuration files in the =$DOOMDIR=:

- =init.el=: This is where DOOM "modules" are loaded; modules are just collections of Emacs packages and configurations. This file is pretty small and straightforward.
- =packages.el=: This is where additional packages are installed (or disabled if they are pulled in by DOOM).
- =config.el=: This is where all of our custom configuration goes. Note that this file can pull in other =*.el= files as well if we want to.

* $DOOMDIR/init.el

#+begin_src elisp :tangle init.el
;;; init.el -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; This file controls what Doom modules are enabled and what order they load
;; in. Remember to run 'doom sync' after modifying it!

;; NOTE Press 'SPC h d h' (or 'C-h d h' for non-vim users) to access Doom's
;;      documentation. There you'll find a "Module Index" link where you'll find
;;      a comprehensive list of Doom's modules and what flags they support.

;; NOTE Move your cursor over a module's name (or its flags) and press 'K' (or
;;      'C-c c k' for non-vim users) to view its documentation. This works on
;;      flags as well (those symbols that start with a plus).
;;
;;      Alternatively, press 'gd' (or 'C-c c d') on a module to browse its
;;      directory (for easy access to its source code).

#+end_src

** Change DOOM's leader key from "SPC" to ","

Here's a rundown of these all-important leader keys:

- =doom-leader-key=: Global leader key for global functions that should work regardless of whatever major mode is active.
- =doom-leader-alt-key=: Same as =doom-leader-key=, but accessible from Evil's Insert and Emacs states.
- =doom-localleader-key=: Major-mode-specific leader key. Brings up lots of commands that are specific to the current major mode.
- =doom-localleader-alt-key=: Same as =doom-localleader-alt-key=, but accessible from Evil's Insert and Emacs states.

NOTE: For all of DOOM's bindings, you can just press the keys and pause, and the minibuffer will tell you what keys are available. So you can explore what options are available interactively!

We use F7 for the alternate leader key in insert mode, because C-, is not a thing (or, at least it doesn't work in terminal Emacs).

FIXME: Use C-, instead (the only reason we don't see it in the terminal is because of Alacritty trying to emulate old terminal behavior)

#+begin_src elisp :tangle packages.el
;; -*- no-byte-compile: t; -*-
;;; $DOOMDIR/packages.el

;; To install a package with Doom you must declare them here and run 'doom sync'
;; on the command line, then restart Emacs for the changes to take effect -- or
;; use 'M-x doom/reload'.

;; To install SOME-PACKAGE from MELPA, ELPA or emacsmirror:
;(package! some-package)

;; To install a package directly from a remote git repo, you must specify a
;; `:recipe'. You'll find documentation on what `:recipe' accepts here:
;; https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el#the-recipe-format
;(package! another-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"))

;; If the package you are trying to install does not contain a PACKAGENAME.el
;; file, or is located in a subdirectory of the repo, you'll need to specify
;; `:files' in the `:recipe':
;(package! this-package
;  :recipe (:host github :repo "username/repo"
;           :files ("some-file.el" "src/lisp/*.el")))

;; If you'd like to disable a package included with Doom, you can do so here
;; with the `:disable' property:
;(package! builtin-package :disable t)

;; You can override the recipe of a built in package without having to specify
;; all the properties for `:recipe'. These will inherit the rest of its recipe
;; from Doom or MELPA/ELPA/Emacsmirror:
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:nonrecursive t))
;(package! builtin-package-2 :recipe (:repo "myfork/package"))

;; Specify a `:branch' to install a package from a particular branch or tag.
;; This is required for some packages whose default branch isn't 'master' (which
;; our package manager can't deal with; see raxod502/straight.el#279)
;(package! builtin-package :recipe (:branch "develop"))

;; Use `:pin' to specify a particular commit to install.
;(package! builtin-package :pin "1a2b3c4d5e")


;; Doom's packages are pinned to a specific commit and updated from release to
;; release. The `unpin!' macro allows you to unpin single packages...
;(unpin! pinned-package)

* $DOOMDIR/config.el

This is the final structured output of =$DOOMDIR/config.el=, which is a special file that DOOM recognizes. Because of the way it acts as the "main" configuration file, you can think of it as =init.el= in the traditional Emacs sense. DOOM has its own =init.el= but that is another matter.

Note that this file is pretty much **required** and acts as the base for all other configurations that are pulled in. And so we define it first here.

** Override default DOOM bindings

*** Basic buffer navigation

**** Intra-buffer navigation

We remap Backspace and Space keys because they are by default aliases to =h= and =l= keys, respectively, making them redundant.

#+name: navigation-buffer-intra
#+begin_src elisp
(map! :m "SPC" (cmd!! #'l/scroll-jump 10)
      :mn "DEL" (cmd!! #'l/scroll-jump -10))
(defun l/scroll-jump (cnt)
  "Scroll by CNT lines."
  (interactive "p")
  (forward-line cnt)
  (evil-scroll-line-to-center nil))
#+end_src

**** Intra-buffer navigation

We remap H and L keys because they do almost-useless things (go to the top and bottom of the current window).

#+name: navigation-buffer-inter
#+begin_src elisp
(map! :m "H" #'previous-buffer
      :m "L" #'next-buffer)
#+end_src

*** Restore old "s" key behavior in Evil normal mode

Remap =s= back to =evil-substitute=, instead of =evil-snipe-s=. However, map =S= to evil-snipe-s because it can't hurt and we never use =S= in vanilla Vim anyway.
#+name: remap-s
#+begin_src elisp
(remove-hook 'doom-first-input-hook #'evil-snipe-mode)
(map! :n "S" #'evil-snipe-s)
#+end_src

*** Remap the "+help" function from ", h" to ", H"

#+name: remap-leader-h
#+begin_src elisp
(map! :leader :desc "help" "H" help-map)
#+end_src

*** Remap the "+notes" function from ", n" to ", N"

FIXME: This can't be done because "n" is bound to a map prefix which is not a function that can be called.

** Window management

#+name: window-management
#+begin_src elisp
<<window-splits>>
<<window-deletion>>
<<window-navigation>>
#+end_src

*** Splits (window creation)

Splitting windows happens so frequently that we put these bindings at the top level just after the leader key.

#+name: window-splits
#+begin_src elisp
(map! :leader "h" #'l/split-vertically
      :leader "v" #'l/split-horizontally)
(defun l/split-vertically ()
  "Split window verically."
  (interactive)
  (split-window-vertically)
  (balance-windows))
(defun l/split-horizontally ()
  "Split window horizontally."
  (interactive)
  (split-window-horizontally)
  (balance-windows))
#+end_src

*** Deletion

If there are multiple windows, close the current window. Otherwise close the current tab if there are mulitple tabs. Otherwise, try to exit emacs.

We take care to tread around so-called "auxiliary" buffers, which are auto-generated buffers from various emacs modes/packages.

FIXME: remap doom emacs' "q" binding to something else

#+name: window-deletion
#+begin_src elisp
(map! :leader "q" #'l/quit-buffer)
(defun l/quit-buffer ()
  "Tries to escape the current buffer by closing it (or moving to a

*** Navigation

Make TAB/S-TAB cycle through windows. We have to take care to disable the TAB keybinding that comes with =evil-org=.

The default binding in evil-org-mode-map is to =org-cycle=, but we don't really use it much because our org files tend to be on the smaller side (well, even if they're big, we just use window splits and tabs aggressively so navigating is never a real issue).

FIXME: Unfortunately this breaks the RET keybinding in org-mode source blocks (in insert mode), as described here: https://www.reddit.com/r/DoomEmacs/comments/pgaf92/ret_key_in_orgmode_source_code_block_in_insert/hba67l4?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

** Tabs

#+name: tab-management
#+begin_src elisp
<<tab-ui>>
<<tab-navigation>>
<<tab-creation>>
#+end_src

*** UI
#+name: tab-ui
#+begin_src elisp
(setq tab-bar-show t
      tab-bar-new-button-show nil
      tab-bar-close-button-show nil
      tab-bar-separator "  ")
#+end_src

*** Creation

We don't have any code for deleting a tab because we only delete windows instead (and only delete the tab when the tab has only one window in it). This is so that we don't accidentally close a tab with a bunch of window splits, which can be laborious to reconstruct.

FIXME: try to see if we can remap this to just "n" instead of "N".

#+name: tab-creation
#+begin_src elisp
(map! :leader "N" #'tab-new)
#+end_src

*** Navigation
#+name: tab-navigation

* Colors

First install the zenburn-theme package, then load it by setting =doom-theme= to it.

#+name: package-zenburn-theme
#+begin_src elisp
(package! zenburn-theme)
#+end_src

#+name: theme
#+begin_src elisp
(setq doom-theme 'zenburn)

* Org mode
#+name: org
#+begin_src elisp
;(after! (evil-org kakapo-mode)
;  (map! (:map (org-mode-map evil-org-mode-map)
;           :i [return] #'kakapo-ret-and-indent
;           :i "RET" #'kakapo-ret-and-indent)))

<<org-misc>>
#+end_src

** Misc

If you use "org" and don't want your org files in the default location below, change org-directory. It must be set before org loads!
#+name: org-misc
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-directory "~/lo/note/")
#+end_src

* Misc settings

** Personal information

Some functionality uses this to identify you, e.g. GPG configuration, email clients, file templates and snippets.
#+name: name-and-email
#+begin_src elisp
(setq user-full-name "Linus Arver"
      user-mail-address "linusarver@gmail.com")
#+end_src

This determines the style of line numbers in effect. If set to "nil", line numbers are disabled. For relative line numbers, set this to "relative".
#+name: line-numbers
#+begin_src elisp
(setq display-line-numbers-type nil)
#+end_src

FIXME: we have to manually turn on kakapo-mode in this org buffer. How can we turn it on automatically?

#+name: kakapo
#+begin_src elisp
(package! kakapo-mode
  :config
  (add-hook 'text-mode-hook #'kakapo-mode)
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'kakapo-mode)
