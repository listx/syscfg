;;;; State system

;; What is "modes" in Vim is "states" in Evil. States are defined
;; with the macro `evil-define-state'.
;;
;; A state consists of a universal keymap (like
;; `evil-normal-state-map' for Normal state) and a buffer-local keymap for
;; overriding the former (like `evil-normal-state-local-map').
;; Sandwiched between these keymaps may be so-called auxiliary
;; keymaps, which contain state bindings assigned to an Emacs mode
;; (minor or major): more on that below.
;;
;; A state may "inherit" keymaps from another state. For example,
;; Visual state will enable Normal state's keymaps in addition to its own.
;; The keymap order then becomes:
;;
;;     <visual-local-map>
;;     <visual auxiliary maps>
;;     <visual-universal-map>
;;     <normal-local-map>
;;     <normal auxiliary maps>
;;     <normal-universal-map>
;;
;; Since the activation of auxiliary maps depends on the current
;; buffer and its modes, states are necessarily buffer-local.
;; Different buffers can have different states, and different buffers
;; enable states differently. (Thus, what keymaps to enable cannot be
;; determined at compile time.) For example, the user may define some
;; Visual state bindings for foo-mode, and if he enters foo-mode and
;; Visual state in the current buffer, then the auxiliary keymap
;; containing those bindings will be active. In a buffer where
;; foo-mode is not enabled, it will not be.
;;
;; Why go to this trouble? Because it allows state bindings to be
;; grouped into Emacs modes. This is useful for writing extensions.
;;
;; All state keymaps are listed in `evil-mode-map-alist', which is
;; then listed in `emulation-mode-map-alist'. This gives state keymaps
;; precedence over other keymaps. Note that `evil-mode-map-alist'
;; has both a default (global) value and a buffer-local value. The
;; default value is constructed when Evil is loaded and its states
;; are defined. Afterwards, when entering a buffer, the default value
;; is copied into the buffer-local value, and that value is reordered
;; according to the current state (pushing Visual keymaps to the top
;; when the user enters Visual state, etc.).

:tag STRING             Mode line indicator.
:message STRING         Echo area message when changing to STATE.
:cursor SPEC            Cursor to use in STATE.
:entry-hook LIST        Hooks run when changing to STATE.
:exit-hook LIST         Hooks run when changing from STATE.
:enable LIST            List of other states and modes enabled by STATE.
:suppress-keymap FLAG   If FLAG is non-nil, makes
                        `evil-suppress-map' the parent of the
                        global map of STATE, effectively disabling
                        bindings to `self-insert-command'.

Following the keywords is optional code to be executed each time
the state is enabled or disabled.

For example:

    (evil-define-state test
      \"A simple test state.\"
      :tag \"<T> \")

The basic keymap of this state will then be
`evil-test-state-map', and so on.
