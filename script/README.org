* Introduction

This Org file houses various scripts we rely on. Each main heading holds a
single script.

** Literate style

See the discussion for [[file:~/syscfg/tmux/README.org][the literate tmux configuration]] about how we use literate
programming in this file. We use the same conventions used there.

* Linters

  - [[file:find-long-lines.org]] :: Detect long lines in Org mode files that could
    probably be reflowed to be under 100 columns.
