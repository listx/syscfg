# Linus Arver's Dotfiles

Use at your own risk!

Also, I will force-push to this repo (rather frequently).

# Installation

Each subdirectory is responsible for one component, and is also the name of a build rule in the `Makefile`.

E.g., to set up Emacs and Vim configurations, do:

```
make emacs vim
```

# Known Issues

- The default repository name, `syscfg`, is hardcoded in some places.
