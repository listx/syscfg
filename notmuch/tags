# Handle unprocessed ("raw") emails, tagging them as them "inbox" and "unread";
# but if they are filtered out of the inbox (aka "Skip the Inbox"), do not tag
# them as "inbox" because that will put them back into the Inbox, going against
# the intent of the Gmail filters.

# For emails that were deleted using the web GUI (from the phone or elsewhere)
# out of band, keep them in the trash.

# Mark deleted emails (deleted from Notmuch via Emacs) to be moved to the trash.
# We work with the "deleted" tag because the default "d" keybinding in Emacs for
# notmuch adds the "deleted" tag (and we don't want to bother customizing that).
