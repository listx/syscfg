# Handle unprocessed ("raw") emails, tagging them as them "inbox" and "unread";
# but if they are filtered out of the inbox (aka "Skip the Inbox"), do not tag
# them as "inbox" because that will put them back into the Inbox, going against
# the intent of the Gmail filters.

# Tag all messages related to the git mailing list. Gmail filters will tag these
# with "git" and "git/ci" and so on. Here we additionally give them a "list" tag
# so that we can search across all emails related to the mailing list at once.
