#env

# -c: practically, this makes less paint lines from the top of the screen
# regardless of line count (LESS will by default only paint from the top if the
# line count exceeds the screen)
#
# -i: make lower-case-only searches case insensitive (mixed-case searches are
# automatically case-sensitive!)
#
# -R: make 'git diff' more compliant with highly customized LESS_TERMCAP options
LESS = -ciR
