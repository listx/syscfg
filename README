You must have "make -f /FULL/PATH/TO/syscfg/makefile -B syscopy" in your /etc/rc.local
for the copysys functionality to work by default!

DO NOT include any config files that have a password in them -- since this means
that should the computer holding syscfg fall into the wrong hands, they will
have a complete history of ALL the passwords used for the entire duration of
the git repo!! (You could ignore this warning if you're sure that (1) the program
using the password is harmless, and (2) the password is unique to that program.)

Some config files do not need to be symlinked at all -- these are the config
files for the applications that do not require a default path, which means that
these applications can be run with options to make it point to files already inside
syscfg, or anywhere else on the system. The following programs are like this:
    * alpine
    * icecast
    * irssi

After updating a core system file (those tracked in syscfg/sys), run the
"makefile -B syscopy" command to reflect those changes and commit them while the
changes are fresh.
