# aex, for "advanced extractor," takes one or more archive files and extracts
# them all intelligently to prevent (1) so-called "tar bombs" that have twenty,
# thirty files in them in the archive's root directory, and (2) spurious,
# nested folders that simply contain other folders (i.e., if an archive,
# after extraction, looks like ./archive-name/archive-name/archive-name/files,
# or the like, aex will remove these middle-men folders to make it look like
# ./archive-name/files).
#
# The beauty of aex is that it can take multiple archive types (a mixture of, say, *.zip and *.tar.gz) and extract them all in one go.
#
# Below is a quick summary of how aex operates.
#
# 1. Verify that every single file passed is a recognized archive type, is a valid existing file, and ensure that a directory bearing the same basename(s) as the file(s) do not already exist
# 2. For each file, do the following:
#    a. Create a new directory based on the file's name
#    b. Extract the file into that directory
#    c. Remove the chain of nested directories, if any

# Colors (comment out to disable)
# format: "1;" means bright, and "38;5;{NUM}" means to use the color NUM from the 256-color palette
c1="\x1b[1;38;5;120m" # bright green
c2="\x1b[1;38;5;228m" # bright yellow
c3="\x1b[1;38;5;214m" # bright orange
c4="\x1b[1;38;5;159m" # bright cyan
c5="\x1b[1;38;5;175m" # bright purple
c6="\x1b[1;38;5;160m" # bright red
ce="\x1b[0m"
